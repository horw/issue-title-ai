  strip-characters:
    description: >
      The best practice is to specify the prompt correctly. However, sometimes the model may return responses
      enclosed in unwanted characters, such as quotes (""). This option allows you to define which characters
      should be stripped from the beginning and end of the response. The specified characters will be removed
      using Python's `strip()` function.
      Example: Using `'"` will remove the characters `"`, `'` from both ends of the response.
