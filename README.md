A GitHub Action that uses AI to automatically improve issue titles, making them more descriptive, actionable, and discoverable.

## üåü Features

- **Smart Title Processing**: Analyzes GitHub issue titles and suggests improvements based on the issue body
- **AI Integration**: Works with multiple AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, or Deepseek)
- **Label Management**: Skips issues that already have a "titled" label and adds the label after processing
- **Flexible Configuration**: Run on schedule, manually, or automatically when issues are created
- **Operation Modes**: Choose between suggestion-only or automatic update mode

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The action scans open issues in your repository
2. Skips any issues already labeled with "titled"
3. For each unlabeled issue, it:
   - Analyzes the title and description
   - Generates an improved title using AI
   - Either updates the title automatically or adds a suggestion comment
   - Adds a "titled" label to prevent re-processing in future runs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

> I have tested with gemini-2.0-flash and deepseek-chat models which work well for this purpose.

1. **Get an API key** from one of the supported AI providers:
   - [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
   - [Deepseek](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys)
2. **Add your API key to your repository secrets**:
   - Go to your repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add a new repository secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` with your API key

3. **Create a workflow file** in your repository at `.github/workflows/issue-title-ai.yml`

## üìã Usage

Here's an example workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: Improve Issue Titles
on:
  # Run hourly
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  # Allow manual trigger
  workflow_dispatch:
  # Run when issues are created
  issues:
    types: [opened]
jobs:
  improve-titles:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Improve Issue Titles
        uses: horw/issue-title-ai@v0.1.7b
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Choose one of these API keys based on your preference
          # openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          gemini-api-key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
          gemini-model: gemini-2.0-flash
          # deepseek-api-key: ${{ secrets.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY }}
          days-to-scan: 7
          auto-update: false
          max-issues: 100
```

### Prompt and Style

You can use the `style` option to apply a predefined prompt.
A few prompt styles are already available for use: `summary`, `order`, and `offense`.
For the full list, visit: [styles folder](https://github.com/horw/issue-title-ai/tree/main/styles).
Contributions are welcome‚Äîfeel free to add your own prompt file and open a pull request!

#### Style Files Best Practices

1. Save style files inside the `styles` folder.
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames that make their purpose easy to understand.
3. For common patterns, use templating. Example: `{include:_footer.md}`

---

By default, the `summary` style is used.

If you prefer to directly provide a custom prompt without adding it to the `styles` folder, use the `prompt` option instead.

When creating a custom prompt, you can use `{original_title}` and `{issue_body}` as placeholders to insert the relevant data.

## üè∑Ô∏è Label Management

IssueTitleAI uses a label system to track processed issues:

- Issues with the "titled" label are automatically skipped
- After processing an issue, the "titled" label is added
- This prevents duplicate processing and allows for easy filtering of processed issues

## üß™ Testing and Development

The project uses the following development tools:

- **Ruff**: For linting and code formatting
- **pytest**: For unit tests with coverage reporting
- **pre-commit**: For automated code quality checks
- **mypy**: For static type checking

## üîÑ Running Locally

To run the tool locally for testing or development:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/horw/issue-title-ai.git
   cd issue-title-ai
   ```

2. Install requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. Set environment variables and run the main script:

   ```bash
   export INPUT_GITHUB-TOKEN=your_github_token
   # Use one of these based on your preferred AI provider
   export INPUT_OPENAI-API-KEY=your_openai_api_key
   # export INPUT_GEMINI-API-KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   # export INPUT_DEEPSEEK-API-KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
   export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo
   python src/main.py
   ```
